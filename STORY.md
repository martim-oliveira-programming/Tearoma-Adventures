# Tearoma Adventures — Prologue

---

**[NAME]!!! Come here, dinner's ready.** — ???

> **[NAME]:** OK, Mom, I’m going!

---

**Mom:** I have to tell you something, sweetie... Your dad is missing. No one knows where he is.

**[NAME]:** … (seems lost in thought) What do you mean Dad’s missing? Where did he go?! He said he would only finish some things at work!

**Mom:** I... I don’t know... (starts to cry)

**[NAME]:** Hey Mom, don’t worry. I’m going to find Dad and bring him back, OK?

**Mom:** No, please wait for the police to find him. You’re only [AGE]. You can’t go around town looking for him!

**[NAME]:** I can’t wait for the police. I’m only going to Dad’s work, then I’ll come back — whether I find him or not. Deal?

**Mom:** Please... don’t go. I can’t lose you too!

---

### ❔ Choice:
> Do you wish to **search for your Dad** or **stay with your Mom**?  
> *(Dad / Mom)*

---

**[NAME]:** I... just can’t, Mom. But I love you, and I’ll come back soon — hopefully with Dad.

---

You leave and start heading toward your dad’s office.  
You remember he said he wouldn’t be working there today — he’d be visiting the **new mine** his company was exploring.

It’s already dark. The street lights flicker, and your watch reads **22:54**.  
This part of the city is dangerous, so you move quickly.

---

You see an elderly lady struggling with her bags, but it’s too dark to be sure.  
> Do you help her? *(Yes / No)*

---

You approach and confirm your suspicion. You help her with the bags.

**Old Lady:** Thank you so much for your help, [GENDER]. Here’s a gift to thank you.

🎁 *You received two chicken sandwiches.*

**[NAME]:** Thank you, ma’am! I really need to get going now. Goodbye.  
*(Thinks)*: I hope I’m not too late…

---

You arrive at the mine. The premises are surrounded by a tall metal fence.

> Should you **cut the fence** or **ask security** to get in?  
> *(Cut / Ask)*

---

You try to cut the fence but get **zapped** and fall to the ground.

You wake up next to the security guard and explain everything.  
Reluctantly, they let you in — one guard accompanies you.

The guard hands you a flashlight as you enter the tunnels.  
As you advance, you begin to see a **purple light** illuminating the cave…

One guard insists on turning back.

**Security Guard:** I don't think we should keep going. It can get dangerous, and we aren't supposed to be here!

**[NAME]:** Maybe, but this light is really weird and we came this far...

**Security Guard:** Fine, but if anything happens I'm leaving you here! I can't get in trouble.

You press on. The light grows stronger until you reach a vast cavern. A group of miners struggles to move a huge rock from the light's source.

**[NAME]:** Excuse me! What are you doing?

**Miner:** Some of our crew entered what looked like a secret passage when this giant rock fell and trapped them inside. We're trying to get them out.

**[NAME]:** Do you know if one of them is called Luca Lanister?

**Miner:** Unfortunately yes. Mr. Lanister is trapped. He was overseeing the operation.

The miners exchange glances, then look at you.

**Miner:** Look, kid—we're really sorry about your dad. We're moving the rock as fast as we can. If you want to help, go ahead, but if you want to go back, now's your chance.

> **Choice:** Do you **help the miners** or **go back**? *(Help / Back)*

**[NAME]:** I'll help move the rock to save my Dad and the others!

As the team finally shifts the boulder, you slip and tumble into a purple crystal hole — a portal.

Alternatively, if you turn to leave, you’re called back as the rock budges. Distracted, you trip and fall into the same purple portal.

---

If you stayed with your **Mom**, you wait for the police, who soon decide to search the mine. You and your mom insist on going along.

Inside the tunnels, the same purple light appears. At the cavern, the rock has already been moved — revealing a shimmering passage.

**Police Officer:** Look, kid, we're really sorry about your dad, but you can't get near that thing. No one knows what it is!

**[NAME]:** But my Dad is in there! Please, I have to go in!

They refuse. You feel helpless. Suddenly, your mom dives into the portal.

**Mom:** I'm going in! I have to find him!

**[NAME]:** Mom, no! I'm going in!

You follow her into the purple passage. A strange sensation washes over you.

---

## Chapter 2: A New World!

You wake up in a vast grassy field under a purple sky with **two suns**. Strange plants and creatures surround you.

**[NAME]:** Where am I? This place looks... strange.

If you came alone, you call out for your Dad but get no answer. If you came with Mom, you realize you're separated. Uneasy, you check your backpack and gather yourself.

**???** — Hello there!

You turn to see a friendly stranger.

**[NAME]:** Who are you? Do you know where we are?

**Stranger:** I’m **Lilly**. We’re on the outskirts of **Volution**!

**[NAME]:** Volution? What is that?

**Lilly:** It’s the capital of **Tearoma**. How do you not know that? Did you hit your head or something?

You explain you're looking for someone and feel lost.

**Lilly:** If you’re new here, I can show you around and help you get used to things.

You accept. Lilly leads you toward the city gates.

**Lilly:** Have you graduated from the academy yet?

**[NAME]:** No, I don’t even know what that is.

**Lilly:** The academy is where everyone learns to survive and get a job.

She asks where you’re from. You answer, “Lisbon, Portugal,” which baffles her.

At Volution’s gates, Lilly calls out to open them. You enter the sprawling city.

**[NAME]:** Wow, this place is huge!

**Lilly:** Yeah, it’s big—lots of shops and places.

You meet **Mark**, Lilly’s friend, who welcomes you and offers help.

They bring you to the academy’s introduction class. The teacher explains how the academy works and asks about your experience with fighting or magic. You admit you have none.

You think to yourself: I’ll have to learn fast and get stronger if you want to find your Dad—or your parents.

The teacher calls students to demonstrate combat, then pairs you with another 15-year-old for your first spar.
