# Tearoma Adventures — Prologue

---

**[NAME]!!! Come here, dinner's ready.** — ???

> **[NAME]:** Ok Mom, I’m going!

---

**Mom:** I have to tell you something, sweety... Your dad is missing. No one knows where he is.

**[NAME]:** … (seems lost in thought) What do you mean Dad’s missing? Where did he go?! He said he would only finish some things at work!

**Mom:** I... I don’t know... (starts to cry)

**[NAME]:** Hey Mom, don’t worry. I’m going to find Dad and bring him back, OK?

**Mom:** No, please wait for the police to find him. You’re only [AGE]. You can’t go around town looking for him!

**[NAME]:** I can’t wait for the police. I’m only going to Dad’s work, then I’ll come back — whether I find him or not. Deal?

**Mom:** Please... don’t go. I can’t lose you too!

---

### ❔ Choice:
> Do you wish to **search for your Dad** or **stay with your Mom**?  
> *(Dad / Mom)*

---

**[NAME]:** I... just can’t, Mom. But I love you, and I’ll come back soon — hopefully with Dad.

---

You leave and start heading towards your dad’s office.  
You remember he said he wouldn’t be working there today — he’d be visiting the **new mine** his company was exploring.

It’s already dark. The street lights flicker, and your watch reads **22:54**.  
This part of the city is dangerous, so you move quickly.

---

You see an elderly lady struggling with her bags, but it’s too dark to be sure.  
> Do you help her? *(Yes / No)*

---

You approach and confirm your suspicion. You help her with the bags.

**Old Lady:** Thank you so much for your help, [GENDER]. Here’s a gift to thank you.

🎁 *You received 2 chicken sandwiches.*

**[NAME]:** Thank you, ma’am! I really need to get going now. Goodbye.  
*(Thinks)*: I hope I’m not too late…

---

You arrive at the mine. The premises are surrounded by a tall metal fence.

> Should you **cut the fence** or **ask security** to get in?  
> *(Cut / Ask)*

---

You try to cut the fence but get **zapped** and fall to the ground.

You wake up next to the security guard and explain everything.  
Reluctantly, they let you in — one guard accompanies you.

The guard hands you a flashlight as you enter the tunnels.  
As you advance, you begin to see a **purple light** illuminating the cave…
